# Rekiden II

**Rekiden II** is a browser-based historical simulation game that reinterprets history as a system of constrained decisions rather than a sequence of heroic actions.

Set in late Sengoku-period Japan, the game follows the life and rule of **Uesugi Kagekatsu**, progressing strictly along historical events while allowing the player to experience how state-level decision-making structures collapse, shrink, or survive under political and military pressure.

This is not a "what-if" history.
This is a simulation of *why things could not go otherwise*.

## Concept

In Rekiden II, the visible protagonist is a historical figure.
The true protagonist, however, is the **state decision-making structure**.

The player believes they are controlling choices.
In reality, they are interacting with a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** that restricts which actions are even possible.

Correct decisions can still lead to failure.
Moral actions can still result in loss.
Survival is not victory.

## Core Features

- **Historically Fixed Timeline**  
  Events follow recorded history. The player cannot rewrite outcomes.

- **FSM-Based State Control**  
  Political, military, and economic states determine which actions are available.

- **Critical Historical Events as State Triggers**
  - The Naoe Letter  
  - The Battle of Sekigahara  
  - The Aizu Relocation and Domain Reduction  

- **Illusion of Control**  
  The interface presents agency while the underlying system steadily removes it.

- **No Win Condition**  
  The only terminal states are survival, marginalization, or collapse.

## Why Uesugi Kagekatsu?

Uesugi Kagekatsu was neither incompetent nor reckless.
He made few objectively catastrophic decisions.

Yet his domain declined.

This makes him an ideal subject to demonstrate how:
- Individual intent fails against systemic constraints
- Loyalty and rationality do not guarantee success
- Political systems punish structural misalignment, not just mistakes

## What This Game Is Not

- Not a power fantasy
- Not an alternate history generator
- Not a tactical war simulator
- Not a character-driven RPG

---

## Technology

- Pure **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- No server-side code
- Fully static deployment via **GitHub Pages**
- Game state stored locally in the browser

---

## Status

This project is experimental and intentionally minimal.
The focus is on structure, not spectacle.

Expect:
- Text-heavy presentation
- Sparse UI
- Uncomfortable outcomes
